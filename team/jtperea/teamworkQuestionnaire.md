# Teamwork Questionnaire for _jtperea_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is easiest to reach me by text or slack. I can reply anytime other than class at 3-4 M/W/F and 12:30-1:45 T/Th. Hours will vary based on work as my hours are variable.
2. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we will work together and accomplish all the tasks for this class.
3. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to learn how to use GitHub better and will stay active on our forms of communication.
4. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Different availability in schedules can cause conflicts in the team goals and variable work hours may affect my personal goals.
5. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think we should all aim for an A if it is within reason.
6. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think work should be split more evenly, but if people are wanting to take on more work, then I think it is acceptable as long as they aren't doing it all by themselves.
7. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * We should spend at least 7 hours or so a week on it.
8. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should discuss everyone's strengths and weaknesses then assign roles based on comfort and willingness and try to divide the work evenly if possible.
9. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I think we should hold a team meeting to discuss what happened and work to ensure it doesn't happen again. 
10. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We should try to aim for the best quality that we can, and if someone doesn't believe another's quality is good enough, they should suggest options to help improve the quality of work.
11. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will suggest we work early and work with anyones habits as long as the work is still getting done.
12. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it would be useful to have a regular meeting outside of class, but I don't think it's required.
13. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think we will meet a couple times every sprint.
14. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the decision. If it's a large one that drastically affects the project then yes. If it's smaller then no.
15. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I think we should go with the majority. Taking time to reach conformity can take away working time.
16. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will let them lead the team process if I agree with their direction, otherwise I will ask the others for suggestions to give everyone a voice in the group.
17. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will ask for suggestions or help from the others, though I am fine facilitating as needed.
