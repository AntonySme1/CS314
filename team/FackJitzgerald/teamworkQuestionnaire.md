# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Jack Fitzgerald_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * reaching me by text/slack or email would be best, I'm available during the day and 
   will try to respond ASAP.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we will be able to communicate and work together to accomplish our goals.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * my personal goals are to work on a consistent basis so I can stay up to date with my teammates and be
   on the same page as them.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * It may be necessary for me to focus my attention on other classes some days, especially for exams.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would try to encourage the others to aim higher and do the best that they can to achieve the "A".
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes by doing more, and if doing more work would somehow prevent others from 
   achieving an "A" then no, I do not think that is acceptable. But if doing so does not and the team is okay with the 
   work being done then I would find it acceptable. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * at least 4-7 hours (an hour a day, or every other day)
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should all individually decide what we would like to work on the most and the least, 
   and then we can discuss our preferences and appropriately assign work. I think we should make it a priority
   that no one works on something they prefer least. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * It would be important to communicate if this happens so we can determine if we need to potentially 
   re-evaluate how we assigned our work. Also I acknowledge that other things in life can happen that can
   cause this.  
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * we should discuss our opinions and work together to improve the quality, but we shouldn't be 
   too nitpicky either. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will try to adjust to the work habits of the team so we can be efficient. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We can decide if we want to meet outside of class and set up a time in slack or something.  
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Probably not too often, only on certain occasions. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It depends on the decision, if it would have an effect on the other team members in any way then I would
   definitely want to let them know and get their opinion before acting on the decision.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I think its important that we can explain ourselves and that we can also be open minded to other team
   members ideas. It may be the case that the one person has a good reason for why they agree/disagree.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If it seems to be negatively affecting us then I would like to talk with the team about 
   how we can resolve the issue.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * If it becomes too much of a burden then I would again like to talk with the team about resolving the issue
   and decide how we can split up the responsibilities moving forward
