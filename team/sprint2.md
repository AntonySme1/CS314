# Sprint 2 - *T10* - *Finite Loop*

## Goal

### A map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *Patrick Keleher*

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT2 assignment.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint2.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo.


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* *#83 User: The calculator data shouldn't go away when units change.*
* *#84 User: It would be nice to see a map with the calculator.*
* *#90 User: Enter latitudes and longitudes in the calculator using degree-minute-second and other formats.*
* *#33 User: I want to know where I am on the map #33*



Key planning decisions for this sprint include ...
Time management and team work. Also ensuring we can get the epics we have planned to get done actually completed. Effective communication is key.

## Review (focus on solution and technology)

In this sprint, ...

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog

These Epics were completed.

* *#32 User: I may need distances in other units of measure*
* *#90 User: Enter latitudes and longitudes in the calculator using degree-minute-second and other formats.*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog

These Epics were not completed.

* #100 User: Show me a map and itinerary for my trip*
* #89 User: It would be nice to see a map with the calculator.*
* #84 User: let me choose from different map backgrounds.*
* #104 I'd like to be able to choose what to display for each destination in the itinerary.*

#### What went well

* The cookies on the calculator page.
* adding multiple markers based off of the users itinerary.  
* Geolocation helped us become much more familiar with react.


#### Problems encountered and resolutions

* The geolocation epic turned out to be more tasks than originally anticipated.
* We were not prioritizing the itinerary epic at first, but we still managed to get most of it finished.


## Retrospective (focus on people, process, tools)

* In this sprint, we began working together as a team more.
* We realized we have to better plan out our sprint and focus on the main epics. 

#### What we changed this sprint

* We spent some time working together.  

#### What we did well

* We stated working together more as a team and planning better.
* The team communicated well throughout the sprint.

#### What we need to work on

* Focusing on what the main epics of the sprint are instead of doing what looks fun.
* We need to work on working together (pair programming).

#### What we will change next sprint

* Doing the main epics of the sprint before doing any others to keep us on track. 
* Spend more time doing pair programming.
