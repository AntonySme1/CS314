# Sprint 2 - *T10* - *Finite Loop*

## Goal

### A map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *Patrick Keleher*

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (team/sprint2.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!

* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo.
