## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog
* *epic number and name*:  comments
*  *TripCo: The application should identify the client and server currently in use #30.*: The server should be working and
            deployed for Sprint1.
#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog
* *epic number and name*: explanation
* *User: I want to know where I am on the map #33*: not enough practice with this API so far to avoid a brute force
         approach and degrade user experience.

#### What went well
* We finished this Sprint with plenty of time to spare.
*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Attempting to do the geolocation Epic just ended up wasting time.
